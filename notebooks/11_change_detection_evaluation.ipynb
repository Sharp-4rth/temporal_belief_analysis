Do we allow regimes to acquire the ultimate deterrent—thereby introducing unknown variables into the global balance of power—or do we pull the lever and make it known that the calculus of power matters and that the great powers of the world are serious about threat *reductions* as opposed to threat *maintenance*?  \n",

      "Proliferation is in many ways, a line of dominoes. A monopoly on nuclear weapons is untenable as far as a balance of power goes, and it would naive to assume the other great powers wouldn’t pursue the bomb. But once the great powers have deterrent capabilities, how do you stop the dominoes from falling?  The printing press made the dissemination of knowledge hard to contain, and it ultimately lead to a massive decentralization of Catholic power—it was abolished in many places. \n",

      "The presence of nuclear weapons is like a tightrope. At first, it is the professional tightrope walkers on the rope, and that is dangerous enough.

      "First, the government isn't constrained for spending by what they take in from taxation. The evidence is the presence of the national debt, which is a backward looking accounting of the difference between federal government spending and taxation. The large increase in debt in the years following the downturn should make this plainly obvious that you can have a large tax cut with increased debt. The inverse is also true, btw. We saw a payroll tax increase in January, that affected you if you work, without reducing the debt in aggregate. They are separate things.\n",

Its a reduction in private nominal assets that a growing populace and economy needs to thrive. If you eliminate it entirely, it will almost certainly be deflationary which is causes much misery to pretty much everyone.\n",

      "First, the government isn't constrained for spending by what they take in from taxation. The evidence is the presence of the national debt, which is a backward looking accounting of the difference between federal government spending and taxation. The large increase in debt in the years following the downturn should make this plainly obvious that you can have a large tax cut with increased debt. The inverse is also true, btw. We saw a payroll tax increase in January, that affected you if you work, without reducing the debt in aggregate. They are separate things.\n",

      "Second, eliminating the debt is the elimination of currency used by the non-government sector for spending. Its a reduction in private nominal assets that a growing populace and economy needs to thrive. If you eliminate it entirely, it will almost certainly be deflationary which is causes much misery to pretty much everyone.\n",
      "\n",
      "Third, those interest payments are the profit of investments by the non-government sector.

It is, by its very existence, a useful public purpose.\n",

For a TL;DR, he is a Wyoming man who put a stock pond on his 8 acre plot of land. He got the permit approved by the Wyoming state government, so it isn't like this was some shady stuff. The guy followed procedure, and strictly followed Wyoming law. However, the EPA swooped in and said he violated the Clean Water Act. He was fined $75,000 *per day* until he paid someone to fill in the pond -- the pond that he already got approved, mind you. Some unelected and unaccountable regulatory agency -- **WHO CAN BE ITS OWN JUDGE VIA CHEVRON AUTHORITY** -- based over a thousand miles away decided to try and ruin a man's life...over a tiny little pond that the state of Wyoming greenlit.\n",

      "The inheritance tax is another issue. It kicks in at $5 million now, thank God, but it used to be ridiculously destructive to farming families by being just $1 million. Especially out west, ranch land can be measured in the high hundreds, and even thousands, of acres. It isn't rare for land that has been in families for generations to be worth well in excess of a million. Even if it isn't at a million, you have to remember: the million cutoff was for *total assets*. So...if Dad has a ton of cattle on his land, a house, a car, and even a small amount of money saved up, his assets are well over that threshold. So...whenever he dies, guess what? The kids have to sell the family farm -- again, in the family for generations -- to pay taxes. Then, the Democrats have the audacity to say that they *didn't pay enough*. Put yourself in their shoes: imagine your last living parent just died, and now some piece of shit in DC practically dancing on their grave is now forcing your family to sell everything just to pay a tax on land that is taxed and was purchased with money that was taxed. Tax, tax, tax, tax, tax, and...it isn't enough? *We're* the greedy ones, when you're profiting off of the death of a loved one? And Democrats fight HARD on this issue, never understanding why it's such a despised policy in rural America.\n",

When the county sheriff's deputy is literally 15-45 minutes away, you've got to be able to take care of yourself. Democrats, though, insist on being anti-gun. And religion...Democrats are so anti-Christian these days. And I know that last one will draw tons of ire from you guys, but...you have no idea. I've seen college professors shit on Christian students for their beliefs; if someone did that to a Muslim student, you guys would be demanding their head on a platter. But because it happens to Christians...no biggie. Military *chaplains* aren't allowed (at least, not under Obama there at the end) to display a cross in their office, or even have a Bible on their desk. It's not 1940s Germany or anything, but it is enough to really piss off religious people. I'm not even that religious, but I hate how Democrats view people like me with scorn. \n",

Offering rule clarifications, in particular, is an important goal of this post. We offer these clarifications in hopes of making as clear as possible how we, the moderators, interpret and enforce the rules — and in turn increasing the number of rule-conforming posts and reducing confusion over post removal. But before we get to that, a few quick things…\n",

[Here is a breakdown](http://i.imgur.com/6vbaN8u.png) of flairs by topic from Jun 28th (when flairs were introduced) until August 7th. As you can see, posts flaired US Elections and US Politics heavily dominate the subreddit. If you’re looking for ideas for quality submissions, consider asking questions pertaining to some of our less common flair topics (Political Theory, Legislation, Non-US Politics, etc).\n",

      "# Keep This Sub Great.\n",
      "\n",
      "For the many who have no interest in [applying to be moderators](https://www.reddit.com/r/PoliticalDiscussion/comments/44by5n/interested_in_moderating_politialdiscussion_is/?st=irz9w9yn&amp;sh=2e93f04b), there are still important ways you can help maintain the quality of this subreddit. In addition to making quality, rule-abiding submissions and comments, please note the following:\n",
      "\n",
      "**1) Be judicious with your downvoting AND reporting.** \n",
      "\n",
      "The goal of this subreddit is to be a great forum where folks with viewpoints from across the spectrum can come and engage each other in high quality discussion. It’s that respect and diversity that makes this subreddit valuable — and downvoting and reporting based on your personal views, not on the subreddit’s rules, can detract from that by silencing minority viewpoints and bolstering majority viewpoints, potentially leading to an echochamber. \n",
      "\n",
      "For example, to help avoid spammers and trolls our subreddit has a minimum karma threshold. A side effect of this is that when a newer user comes in and posts a respectful but unpopular viewpoint, they can lose so much karma that they are unable to post in the subreddit thereafter. \n",
      "\n",

      "* **Soapboxing.** Our current soapboxing rule specifies that submissions should not soapbox your political agenda. Many users interpret this to mean that submissions simply cannot be rants or overt campaigning. While these posts are prohibited, moderators take a more strict interpretation of the rules (in particular over the course of the election season) and require that users *aim for neutrality in content and tone of their submissions*. (All users are then free, of course, to express their opinions in the comment section.) This helps ensure that an open discussion can flow from the submission text as opposed to one side or viewpoint immediately being on the defensive. This interpretation also helps with consistency in moderation as it is easier to make a yes/no determination on neutrality of a post rather than a “how editorialized is too editorialized?” determination. Editorialized submissions and opinion pieces are better off over at /r/PoliticalOpinions.\n",
      "\n",
      "* **Low Effort Posts.** Submissions should raise at least one highly substantial question that will elicit thoughtful discussion. As discussed, posts pertaining to recent news very often fail to pass this litmus test. Posts that boil down to “Thoughts?” or “Discuss” will be removed, as will purely speculative surface level questions like “Who will win in November?”. And although we try to be quick with our removals, even a thread that already has been upvoted or has discussion ongoing may be subject to removal if the OP is very low effort. It’s also worth reiterating that for comments, jokes, memes, quips, sarcastic one-off remarks, one-word answers to thoughtful questions, etc., are prohibited. Repeated offenses will result in a ban.\n",
      "\n",
      "* **Meta Posts.** This one is simple, but there’s occasionally still confusion. Do not make comments or submissions that discuss reddit, other subreddits, this subreddit, downvotes, threads, posts, comments, or anything else referring back to this subreddit. Full stop.

The issue I have voting for any Republican is that I wish they would stop caring what two consenting adults choose to do with their lives.

      "*\"Although **no country has ever had within its border an economy in which all markets were absolutely free**, the term typically is not used in an absolute sense. Many states which are said to have a market economy have a high level of market freedom, even if it is less than some parts of the population would prefer. Thus, almost all economies in the world today are mixed economies with varying degrees of free market and planned economy traits. For example, in the United States there are more market economy traits than in the Western European countries (an exception being the UK, which is considered, even by Greenspan, to be a freer market than the US).\"*\n",

I love opinion and discussion, even as vile as it gets, and would never seek to prevent it in any kind of way.  The problem is that the upvote/downvote system and resulting Karma was supposed to reflect quality of comments, not agreement or disagreement with an opinion.  But in opinion subreddits like /r/politics, it's clear they are now used for the latter.  I don't propose a solution; I just wanted to make everyone aware of the bug.\n",

      "Reply-to post: Just to clear up a common misunderstanding, there are zero subsidies being provided to oil companies.   A subsidy is a payment from the government to a private company.   Farmers being paid not to grow crops is a genuine example of this.  So is the funding of alternative energy, such as ethanol.\n",
      "\n",
      "Oil companies operate under a tax accounting structure that is in no way unique among any other corporations, other than the tax rate on oil industry net income is typically higher (41%) than the tax rate on other U.S. corporations (35%), due to less favorable amortization treatment on certain capital outlays.   Oil companies receive less tax credits than other similar industries, such as mining corporations.   There are also examples where oil companies receive less deductions than other manufacturers in other regulations, such as with the Domestic Manufacturer’s Deduction (Section 199):\n",
      "\n",
      "&gt;A deduction (not a credit) equal to 9% of income earned from manufacturing, producing, growing or extracting in the United States, is available to every single taxpayer who qualifies in the U.S. The oil and gas industry, and only the oil and gas industry, is limited to a 6% deduction.\n",
      "\n",
      "When politicians (who assume the voting base know nothing about business accounting) talk about ending \"subsidies\" for oil companies they mean singling out oil companies for a tax accounting process that would focus only on gross revenues.  This is ridiculous on its face, and would only result is the passing on of higher energy costs to the consumer, or more likely a complete bankruptcy of the oil companies forced to operate under such an unusually unfair tax accounting treatment. \n",
      "\n",
      "Which is exactly the intent. This is in fact a play at nationalization of the oil industry by said politicians.   Next time you hear \"oil subsidies\" from the politicians mouth, they are being dishonest to you (or are complete idiots) and take you for a fool.\n",

These two effects would basically cancel each other out, I think - maybe they'd be a few more jobs at first from companies quickly hiring people, but then there would be less money for common workers (the bulk spenders), resulting in less goods and services bought (unless they're willing to rack up a ton of debt...), meaning loss for companies, meaning people would be laid off again/forced into lower wages. \n",

Let me try to explain you what corporate taxes are.\n",

      "Alright, so a corporation first gets taxed on its earnings, just like everyone else. There are a lot of loopholes to these taxes that people complain about. I am personally against taxes anyway, but there is a reason that I actually support these loopholes, and it’s because corporations get taxed **TWICE**. That’s right; the money a corporation makes gets taxed two times. How does this work, you say? As I stated earlier, a corporation first gets taxed on its income. But, let’s step back and think about what a corporation really is and who the income is going to. The owners of a corporation who receive the income are not some sort of Wall-Street businessmen who are bathing in money. The people who own a corporation are YOU AND ME. More specifically, probably your parents since you are on Reddit. That’s right; your parents are owners of  multiple corporations. If you own any stock, then you own part of a corporation. If your job gives you diversified stock, then you own multiple corporations.\n",

      "So, who is hurt by this first corporation tax? I am, because I own stock. Since the corporation has less profit, then it has less money to distribute to me in the form of dividends. AND, when it does distribute dividends to me, the government taxes the dividends. That means the money I receive is taxed TWICE. There seems to be a consensus on this website that the people benefitting from corporate loopholes are the CEOs and higher-ups. Do you really think they aren’t going to get their money because of tax? They are going to get their money either way. When you tax a corporation, you are really taxing working-class America. \n",

      "Utterance: Perhaps I'm just a little ignorant, but I've been hearing alot about HR 3261 -- also known as SOPA -- and I think it makes some sense. Basically any form of intellectual property can exist on the internet; music, writing, film, images. Yet copyright laws seem a little loosely enforced on the world wide web. If the government has laws against copyright infringment, yet they're loosely enforced on the internet (which is most people's primary source for media), then intellectual property laws are pretty much useless...right? It's like having a fence with a hole in it. On that side of the coin, I can see the reasoning behind SOPA. \n",
      "\n",
      "On the flipside, I don't give a fuck about intellectual property laws. As a writer and musician, It's pretty evident to me that intellectual property laws do nothing to serve the owner of the intellect from wence the property came! So there's kind of a circular reasoning thing happening here: If the laws exist, they need to be enforced. But then...do the laws really need to exist in the first place? This dilemma seems to be a trademark of US law, just ask any pot smoker in America. \n",

      "It has recently been concluded among the Israeli Supreme Court that Palestinians are more than just second-class citizens, but that they are a genuine threat to the security of that state merely because of their ethnicity. In the past any attempt to draw parallels between the Israeli occupation and the Nazi racial state have been met with disdain, after all, a thread dies once the topic switches to Nazi’s. However, after this act I feel it is absolutely necessary to draw a small parallel between this law and one passed in 1935. To say that the two laws are equitable is a bit rash, but certainly they remain in the same spirit, and partake of the same basic ideological framework; the need for a pure ethnic racial state. I do not here make the claim that Israelis are Nazis, merely that the trend of Israeli action is designed to ensure a racial and religious state that is unhindered by the threat that they denote the Arabs.\n",

After searching around Facebook I only found a few groups about SOPA and PIPA that had very little support and even less information about them. I suggest that someone make a group on Facebook that list out the facts in an easy to understand way that speaks to the common Facebook user and grabs their attention. I would do this myself but I do not think that I know enough about the issues to really do it justice. If someone can do this and we can get it to the front page for everyone to see. The result can be informing people on an exponential scale. Facebook is a great way to inform people and we need to take advantage of it. \n",

      "Reply-to post: It could be that American's political opinions are so molded by the two party system it is the voters themselves who are contributing to the problem. It's not quite Orwellian but probably not too far off either. If you've grown up and lived in a country with basically two idealogical choices making the choice for an unknown commodity has to be difficult. I don't think it's necessarily a problem that only affects older voters either. It's a transformational process. When you're 18 you might support a third party candidate out of a sense of anarchy or bucking the system. When you're 28 you've started to develop a two-party bias. You're an independent but you vote for the same party most of the time. When you're 38 you've realized both parties, more or less, continue the status quo but you've got a mortgage and a decent job so you kind of like the status quo now. When you're 48 you're a reliable vote. You might even officially start calling yourself a Republican or Democrat. That's about it. There may be some specific issues or candidates that could break the cycle but you're more inclined to vote for one of the two parties that has run the country your entire life. Even if you don't particularly like one of the parties you know there's another election in 2/4 years so it probably doesn't matter much either way. Lesser of two evils. \n",

      "Utterance: If we are truly going to talk facts, you can't say with certainty that the stimulus did not work.  While some economists say that it failed, many more said it worked or wasn't large enough.  The majority of economists agree that the original stimulus package prevented the recession from becoming a depression.  Here is a link with various views to get you started: http://roomfordebate.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/11/01/did-the-stimulus-work/.\n",
      "\n",
      "Another fact is the government absolutely can create jobs, and private sector jobs at that.  Designating specific roads and bridges for reconstruction/repair will free up federal dollars for states to hire private contractors to complete those projects.  Those are REAL jobs in the private sector, not a government job. \n",
      "\n",
      "For this bill to pass, it is going to require both parties to come together.  The Democrats will have to agree to actual spending cuts, and the Republicans will have to commit themselves to restructuring the tax code.  Positive change can only come through compromise, as our forefathers intended when they wrote the constitution.\n",

Increasing tax cuts for corporations and individuals with vast wealth provides no guarantee that those dollars will be put back into the economy or be used towards job creation.  The proposals put forth by our President this evening will provide a GUARANTEE of JOB CREATION.  It is really that simple.

Reducing unnecesary regulations will increase my revenue.\n",

      "I agree we need to reduce our deficit.  Making appropriate spending cuts and reducing waste will help.  But our debt is over $14 trillion.  We need to change our tax code.  Get rid of tax loopholes, so there is accurate reporting of profit.  Tax corporations based on their profit, so those that are well off pay appropriate amounts of tax.  Pass legislation that will guarantee jobs.  More jobs means more Americans paying taxes.  More taxes equals more government revenue.  More revenue will lead to more dollars to pay down our debt.\n",

      "Reply-to post: Okay lets talk about facts. His first stimulus. His economic advisers calculated that the stimulus would create 3 million jobs and keep us from going above 8% unemployment. They even had a cute graph and everything. Guess what happened when they passed the stimulus? Unemployment went higher then they predicted that it would go if they didn't pass it. That is the record. \n",
      "\n",
      "How can the president guarantee actual job growth? He did that with his stimulus and it didn't happen. This is half the size so how do you expect it to do anything? If the president is telling the truth about paying for this thing and I doubt he is, then there will be no increase in spending. We will cut spending somewhere else. This means we will not be boosting aggregate demand like the Keynesians want us to. \n",
      "\n",
      "The government can't create jobs. It can only suck resources away from the private sector. A government job is just a drag on the private sector. All you are looking to is the claimed seen effects of this new stimulus. He is claiming something, but you don't bother to look at the negative effects. To pay for this I doubt we actually cut the spending. We will have to tax, borrow, or inflate. Most likely the latter two. Those two options have a negative consequence on the economy. \n",

Increasing tax cuts for corporations and individuals with vast wealth provides no guarantee that those dollars will be put back into the economy or be used towards job creation.  The proposals put forth by our President this evening will provide a GUARANTEE of JOB CREATION.  It is really that simple.  As a small business owner in the 3rd district, I welcome the President's proposals on continuing the payroll tax and adding additional payroll tax cuts for small business.  This will allow me to increase my revenue.  As my profit increases, I expect to pay additional taxes, so I can insure my children receive a great education, and can go see a doctor when they are sick.  Reducing unnecesary regulations will increase my revenue.\n",

Pass legislation that will guarantee jobs.  More jobs means more Americans paying taxes.  More taxes equals more government revenue.  More revenue will lead to more dollars to pay down our debt.\n",

      "Utterance: I completely agree with this.  **This** is the person I voted for in 2008.  I can only hope he has spent the last two years playing the \"long con\", knowing it would take 8 years to accomplish his goals.  With 4 years in office without the any reelection concerns, he can stop bending to the will of the party of \"no\", and truly move this country forward.  I hope that is the case, because it kind of feels like we have had a Republican president since the health care legislation was passed.\n",

Never heard a speech of his I didn't like, I just hate how poorly he follows through when he comes against opposition. And he will always face opposition, so I suppose the future of his good jobs plan depends on how harshly the republicans react to it.\n",
