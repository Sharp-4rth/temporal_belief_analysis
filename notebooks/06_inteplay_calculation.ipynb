It\\'s the old people who only watch fox news who continue to hold us back. \\n\\nedit: also a couple more things. \\n\\nThe healthcare bill that was passed, disappointed most liberals like myself. And I really can\\'t figure out why conservatives are mad about it. It didn\\'t do hardly anything. I literally don\\'t know what else you could do to make it a weaker bill. We need *reform* not a tiny bill that covers more people. \\n\\nAlso, it seems europe and asia are the place to be now. US is on the way out. I really feel that way. Instead of trying to reform and fix out education system, they\\'re talking about cutting it. We\\'re doing nothing to fix our broken infrastructure. We have so much money in this country, and it just goes to waste. We talk and talk and talk about doing something every election, and nothing ever gets done. This country really hasn\\'t made actual progress since FDR. When a country like the czech republic (not that there\\'s anything wrong with CR) over takes the US in many areas, something is seriously, seriously wrong. ', 'Let me affirm my tone here, I am not trying to \"debate\" anything with you. Simply a rational, calm discussion of viewpoints. \\n\\nDon\\'t misconstrue what I\\'m saying. It\\'s not like I watch only MSNBC and believe every word of every sensationalist headline. I too am immediately skeptical of anything that seems, well, \\'fishy\\'. I too immediately click the comments on many reddit submissions and see many top comments directly contradicting what the article headline says. I appreciate this. \\n\\nIronically I am certainly labeled as a \"far left winger\", but in my view, I don\\'t see myself as far left wing at all really. I would say my views are mostly moderate/heavily left leaning. It\\'s just that this country is so far to the *right*, that it makes people like me seem extreme, when I think my views are quite sensible (such as how I think everyone living in this country should have access to affordable healthcare, how extreme right?). I also think we should be trying to get off oil as soon as possible, we are FAR over due for that. Yet many conservatives label me as far left wing. I mean, ideally how great would it be for everyone to have electric cars, charged by solar panels on their own house? Yet somehow that totally sensible idea makes me a hippy. \\n\\n&gt;Yes I can deny that. That is not factual in any way. Please tell me in what ways specifically this has occurred? \\n\\nI already listed a few. Whole agencies dedicated to taping and recording millions of phone calls, emails, text messages sent *domestically*, from every day citizens. No warrant needed. Where is the outrage? No one cares, including yourself it seems. I\\'m assumed to be a terrorist when I go to the airport. Yes we need safety, but the TSA (as reddit loves to point out) is literally just security theater. How many bomb plots have they stopped? None? As soon as a terrorist puts a bomb up their ass, we\\'ll probably have anal probing at check in. I wish I was being sarcastic (I also never would have thought we would have full body scanners, but alas, the underwear bomber). The TSA is simply knee jerk reactionary to anything that happens. It\\'s useless. \\n\\nWe\\'re also detaining \"enemy combatants\" with no trial, indefinitely. That is literally about the most \"unamerican\" thing you could ever do. That\\'s exactly what the founding fathers wanted to protect against. But it seems the leaders of the US are simply just trying to find little ways around their intentions. \"Oh, they aren\\'t US citizens, it\\'s ok\" -they\\'re still people. It\\'s despicable. \\n\\nAgree or disagree with OWS, the actions that have been taken against them are unbelievable. It\\'s really, really hard to defend the police and say they have our best interests. They simply don\\'t. If they did, they would join us. Instead the just beat down citizens. They\\'re literally corporate mercenaries. ']\n",

Might I suggest you take both with huge grains of salt and look more closely at what is going on and why today is no different than many other times in our country\\'s history. \\n\\nBoth sides are pushing, and frankly the liberal side has been winning many debates in the last few decades. Look at how some healthcare reform was actually passed? Look at how much more accepted gays &amp; lesbians are now. Some states have legal marriage or at least partnership laws in place. Abortions are more readily available than they were 20 years ago. Information on your government is more readily available than it was 20 years ago, at your fingertips, online! \\n\\nThe tendency, it seems, of the young liberals on reddit, is to scream about whats wrong and how its impossible to change it. This seems insane to me. You have A) ignored the progress that has been made and B) you are actually giving up without a fight to create more progress.\\n\\nWHY? what is causing this? Who is teaching you this absolute crap? And how, in the world, will things get \"better\" in \"20 years\" if YOU and the youth of America don\\'t stand up and help make them better instead of saying that its futile and there is nothing that can be done?? ', '&gt;I agree that liberals have been winning the long term war, certainly. I mean, to put it bluntly, conservatism is simply stupid. But conservatives are digging in their heels with major money behind them.\\n\\nYou, my friend, do not seem to be aware that in the world there needs to be a yin and a yang. Were we to be devoid of conservatism, then liberalism would be run amok, and that would be a bad thing (believe it or not). We need some people with some conservative ideas. Mind you, I am thinking of traditional conservatives, not right wing fanatics. We need neither right wing nor left wing fanatics in this country. For my tastes, this particular site has one too many left wing fanatics that are whipping people like yourself up into believing that we are worse than we really are. That is how politics works, factions make you afraid in order for you to accept their ideology. I don\\'t respond to nor do I respect any politics driven by fear. \\n\\n&gt;Abortions are starting to become more limited. Coming up with new laws about exact specifications of the clinics, otherwise they get shut down (ie: the air temperature, wtf).\\n\\nWhere? how? some very limited states perhaps, but on the whole, big picture, they are more available now than they were before. You can\\'t focus on every skirmish, you need to see the big picture, the war is being won on that front, and in fact it is doubtful that it can ever go backwards. \\n\\n&gt; I mean, the fact that we\\'re still having the debate is what\\'s terrifying.\\n\\nNo, the fact that we are still having a debate is wonderful, its exciting, it means that the minority of this country (who want abortions illegal) are not subject to tyranny from the majority. That is a good thing. That means that when YOU voice a minority opinion you will not be subject to tyranny either. There are people who still are racist, and speak their racists views every day. Does that mean we are going backwards? Hardly, it just means that we have freedom of speech.\\n\\n&gt; I don\\'t ignore what\\'s been done, I admit a lot has been done. But I don\\'t even feel like we\\'re to the middle. The fact that we still have to have debates to treat gay people like regular citizens is the problem. I feel like we\\'ve gone up a hill pretty quickly, but now we\\'re slowing down.\\n\\nThe middle? What is the middle? Politics evolve every year, every decade, every century. We are in a never ending process of change. There is no middle, there is then and there is now. Are we better now than we were then? If the answer is no on a particular issue then we are losing the battle of improvement in this country. My argument is that, on the whole, we are a lot better now than we were then, and you can pick almost any \"then\" you want. There are some exceptions to that, and thats where we need to improve. Economy is a big issue that stands out in my mind at the moment.\\n\\n&gt;No one is \"teaching\" me anything. I\\'m simply observing what\\'s going on. I just see the US becoming more and more totalitarian every year and it makes me want to move to a free country. \\n\\nThen you are seeing things incorrectly. I would argue you have no sense of where you are in history. I would also argue that you do not know what totalitarian means. In short, you still live in one of the most free places in the world. A\\n\\n&gt;You can\\'t deny the US is certainly closer to north korea practices than say over a decade ago.\\n\\nYes I can deny that. That is not factual in any way. Please tell me in what ways specifically this has occurred? \\n\\n&gt;I really don\\'t feel \"free\". I feel like this country has become an Orwellian novel.\\n\\nYou do not feel that way because you consume, by and large, alarmist left wing media. There are people on the right who only consume alarmist right wing media and they are just as manipulated into believing false things about our country. This is what political factions want in this country. This is why they control our process, because people like you are willing to fall for it, over and over again.\\n\\nI would say... ask... beg... that you come to a new way of thinking: become a Moderate. Not just any moderate, become a hardcore moderate like me. Do you know what defines moderates? The idea that we can take in pieces of information in the media, view all sides and come to a conclusion without listening to the talking points of the left or right wing. Whenever I read a story about something happening, I immediately question it. I reference it, and I put it in context to what has happened previously in the history of our country. \\n\\nI can give you many examples of this, and luckily there are some Redditors who make it their mission to respond to alarmist headlines that appear in places like r/politics to point out where, factually, the alarmism is incorrect.']\n",

You can\\'t deny the US is certainly closer to north korea practices than say over a decade ago. I really don\\'t feel \"free\". I feel like this country has become an Orwellian novel. \\n\\nTo be honest, I\\'m actually shocked that OWS is taking place. And yet, I still feel the outrage isn\\'t enough. More people are outraged over a dead blond girl they never knew, rather than corporations literally buying politicians and laws to further their own interests. \\n\\nIn 20 years, many of the older conservative people in this country will have died off. I know every generation says \"we will be the different generation\". But I do truly feel that this generation *will* be different, and for one major reason. The internet. As the saying goes, education has a liberal bias. When kids are growing up with the internet, seeing both sides of the argument, conservatism loses. We\\'ve never had information accessible like this before. It\\'s the old people who only watch fox news who continue to hold us back. \\n\\nedit: also a couple more things. \\n\\nThe healthcare bill that was passed, disappointed most liberals like myself. And I really can\\'t figure out why conservatives are mad about it. It didn\\'t do hardly anything. I literally don\\'t know what else you could do to make it a weaker bill. We need *reform* not a tiny bill that covers more people. \\n\\nAlso, it seems europe and asia are the place to be now. US is on the way out. I really feel that way. Instead of trying to reform and fix out education system, they\\'re talking about cutting it. We\\'re doing nothing to fix our broken infrastructure. We have so much money in this country, and it just goes to waste. We talk and talk and talk about doing something every election, and nothing ever gets done. This country really hasn\\'t made actual progress since FDR. When a country like the czech republic (not that there\\'s anything wrong with CR) over takes the US in many areas, something is seriously, seriously wrong. ', 'Let me affirm my tone here, I am not trying to \"debate\" anything with you. Simply a rational, calm discussion of viewpoints. \\n\\nDon\\'t misconstrue what I\\'m saying. It\\'s not like I watch only MSNBC and believe every word of every sensationalist headline. I too am immediately skeptical of anything that seems, well, \\'fishy\\'. I too immediately click the comments on many reddit submissions and see many top comments directly contradicting what the article headline says. I appreciate this. \\n\\nIronically I am certainly labeled as a \"far left winger\", but in my view, I don\\'t see myself as far left wing at all really. I would say my views are mostly moderate/heavily left leaning. It\\'s just that this country is so far to the *right*, that it makes people like me seem extreme, when I think my views are quite sensible (such as how I think everyone living in this country should have access to affordable healthcare, how extreme right?). I also think we should be trying to get off oil as soon as possible, we are FAR over due for that. Yet many conservatives label me as far left wing. I mean, ideally how great would it be for everyone to have electric cars, charged by solar panels on their own house? Yet somehow that totally sensible idea makes me a hippy. \\n\\n&gt;Yes I can deny that. That is not factual in any way. Please tell me in what ways specifically this has occurred? \\n\\nI already listed a few. Whole agencies dedicated to taping and recording millions of phone calls, emails, text messages sent *domestically*, from every day citizens. No warrant needed. Where is the outrage? No one cares, including yourself it seems. I\\'m assumed to be a terrorist when I go to the airport. Yes we need safety, but the TSA (as reddit loves to point out) is literally just security theater. How many bomb plots have they stopped? None? As soon as a terrorist puts a bomb up their ass, we\\'ll probably have anal probing at check in. I wish I was being sarcastic (I also never would have thought we would have full body scanners, but alas, the underwear bomber). The TSA is simply knee jerk reactionary to anything that happens. It\\'s useless. \\n\\nWe\\'re also detaining \"enemy combatants\" with no trial, indefinitely. That is literally about the most \"unamerican\" thing you could ever do. That\\'s exactly what the founding fathers wanted to protect against. But it seems the leaders of the US are simply just trying to find little ways around their intentions. \"Oh, they aren\\'t US citizens, it\\'s ok\" -they\\'re still people. It\\'s despicable. \\n\\nAgree or disagree with OWS, the actions that have been taken against them are unbelievable. It\\'s really, really hard to defend the police and say they have our best interests. They simply don\\'t. If they did, they would join us. Instead the just beat down citizens.

But conservatives are digging in their heels with major money behind them.\\n\\nYou, my friend, do not seem to be aware that in the world there needs to be a yin and a yang. Were we to be devoid of conservatism, then liberalism would be run amok, and that would be a bad thing (believe it or not). We need some people with some conservative ideas. Mind you, I am thinking of traditional conservatives, not right wing fanatics. We need neither right wing nor left wing fanatics in this country. For my tastes, this particular site has one too many left wing fanatics that are whipping people like yourself up into believing that we are worse than we really are. That is how politics works, factions make you afraid in order for you to accept their ideology. I don\\'t respond to nor do I respect any politics driven by fear. \\n\\n&gt;Abortions are starting to become more limited.

You can\\'t focus on every skirmish, you need to see the big picture, the war is being won on that front, and in fact it is doubtful that it can ever go backwards. \\n\\n&gt; I mean, the fact that we\\'re still having the debate is what\\'s terrifying.\\n\\nNo, the fact that we are still having a debate is wonderful, its exciting, it means that the minority of this country (who want abortions illegal) are not subject to tyranny from the majority. That is a good thing. That means that when YOU voice a minority opinion you will not be subject to tyranny either. There are people who still are racist, and speak their racists views every day. Does that mean we are going backwards? Hardly, it just means that we have freedom of speech.\\n\\n&gt; I don\\'t ignore what\\'s been done, I admit a lot has been done. But I don\\'t even feel like we\\'re to the middle. The fact that we still have to have debates to treat gay people like regular citizens is the problem. I feel like we\\'ve gone up a hill pretty quickly, but now we\\'re slowing down.\\n\\nThe middle? What is the middle? Politics evolve every year, every decade, every century. We are in a never ending process of change. There is no middle, there is then and there is now. Are we better now than we were then? If the answer is no on a particular issue then we are losing the battle of improvement in this country. My argument is that, on the whole, we are a lot better now than we were then, and you can pick almost any \"then\" you want. There are some exceptions to that, and thats where we need to improve. Economy is a big issue that stands out in my mind at the moment.\\n\\n&gt;No one is \"teaching\" me anything. I\\'m simply observing what\\'s going on. I just see the US becoming more and more totalitarian every year and it makes me want to move to a free country. \\n\\nThen you are seeing things incorrectly. I would argue you have no sense of where you are in history. I would also argue that you do not know what totalitarian means. In short, you still live in one of the most free places in the world. A\\n\\n&gt;You can\\'t deny the US is certainly closer to north korea practices than say over a decade ago.\\n\\nYes I can deny that. That is not factual in any way. Please tell me in what ways specifically this has occurred? \\n\\n&gt;I really don\\'t feel \"free\". I feel like this country has become an Orwellian novel.\\n\\nYou do not feel that way because you consume, by and large, alarmist left wing media. There are people on the right who only consume alarmist right wing media and they are just as manipulated into believing false things about our country. This is what political factions want in this country. This is why they control our process, because people like you are willing to fall for it, over and over again.\\n\\nI would say... ask... beg... that you come to a new way of thinking: become a Moderate. Not just any moderate, become a hardcore moderate like me. Do you know what defines moderates? The idea that we can take in pieces of information in the media, view all sides and come to a conclusion without listening to the talking points of the left or right wing. Whenever I read a story about something happening, I immediately question it. I reference it, and I put it in context to what has happened previously in the history of our country. \\n\\nI can give you many examples of this, and luckily there are some Redditors who make it their mission to respond to alarmist headlines that appear in places like r/politics to point out where, factually, the alarmism is incorrect.']\n",

However, when I hear a college kid say he doesn't like where things are at, but doesn't want to get involved and instead just wants to quit and move away, it worries me. It speaks to what I hope is not a generational attitude of laziness. How will he deal with other problems that face him in life that seem \"too big\"? Lets be clear, we are all (not just the young generation) facing a tough job market. This job market looked this way in 2001 as well. It is not the first time, nor the last. And, as one astute redditor pointed out (I apologize for not having a link) the baby boom generation is leaving the workforce, which, over the course of the next decade will create a fantastic boom &amp; great job demand.\n",

I think some cases have been blown out of proportion and shame on the students and parents, for agreeing to debt terms such as those.\n",

I can't say I agreed with the OWS protest tactics or lack of message, but if I was a college kid I would have certainly been out there with them. It remains a great mystery to me why more kids didn't get active if things are as bad young redditors portray them to be? To me it really does speak to the generational laziness... \"lets post online about it rather then get out and do something.\"\n",
