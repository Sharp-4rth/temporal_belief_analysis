Positive lines have been crossed that were never crossed before.\\n\\nChanges in healthcare law, increasingly accepted gays in society, gay partnership and/or gay marriage, more readily available information about your government at your fingertips due to internet and government having to conform to making things available, and that is just to name a few.\\n\\nEconomically, in the past 25 years we have been up (Clinton) and down (now). No doubt there are shitty things happening with economic policy. But this will change. Additionally, we are all dealing with being concerned about increasing draconian laws that could arise in the name of fighting \"terrorism\". Yet, there have been bright spots that have been challenged in court and reaffirmed our constitution. Those don\\'t seem to get play here as much.\\n\\nAs for local involvement and how that relates to bigger things: When I started, I met many people (all local). Recently, one of those people has gone from being a city representative to a state rep. Because I was able to make my connection, my network just became a lot bigger, and so did my ability to have a greater level of involvement. Its just a matter of going to meetings, getting involved and engaging people. I hope that my involvement will some day allow me to be more involved nationally as well.', 'I agree, we do probably agree on a great many things.\\n\\n&gt;&gt; I still don\\'t think it\\'s my place to judge someone who is not interested in doing that as \"lazy\\n\\nI also agree, someone who doesn\\'t want to get involved shouldn\\'t be labeled as lazy. However, when I hear a college kid say he doesn\\'t like where things are at, but doesn\\'t want to get involved and instead just wants to quit and move away, it worries me. It speaks to what I hope is not a generational attitude of laziness. How will he deal with other problems that face him in life that seem \"too big\"?', 'Lets be clear, we are all (not just the young generation) facing a tough job market. This job market looked this way in 2001 as well. It is not the first time, nor the last. And, as one astute redditor pointed out (I apologize for not having a link) the baby boom generation is leaving the workforce, which, over the course of the next decade will create a fantastic boom &amp; great job demand. \\n\\nAs for crushing debt, I disagree that every student faces crushing debt.  I think some have taken bad loans because their parents and teachers failed them. But if all you did was utilize the federal loan program available, then you aren\\'t in crushing debt. I think some cases have been blown out of proportion and shame on the students and parents, for agreeing to debt terms such as those. \\n\\nThe amount of actual OWS protesters was a minority of the youth in this country, a mere fraction of them. I can\\'t say I agreed with the OWS protest tactics or lack of message, but if I was a college kid I would have certainly been out there with them. It remains a great mystery to me why more kids didn\\'t get active if things are as bad young redditors portray them to be?

I also think we should be trying to get off oil as soon as possible, we are FAR over due for that. Yet many conservatives label me as far left wing. I mean, ideally how great would it be for everyone to have electric cars, charged by solar panels on their own house? Yet somehow that totally sensible idea makes me a hippy. \\n\\n&gt;Yes I can deny that. That is not factual in any way.

How many bomb plots have they stopped? None? As soon as a terrorist puts a bomb up their ass, we\\'ll probably have anal probing at check in. I wish I was being sarcastic (I also never would have thought we would have full body scanners, but alas, the underwear bomber). The TSA is simply knee jerk reactionary to anything that happens. It\\'s useless. \\n\\nWe\\'re also detaining \"enemy combatants\" with no trial, indefinitely. That is literally about the most \"unamerican\" thing you could ever do. That\\'s exactly what the founding fathers wanted to protect against. But it seems the leaders of the US are simply just trying to find little ways around their intentions. \"Oh, they aren\\'t US citizens, it\\'s ok\" -they\\'re still people.

This is why they control our process, because people like you are willing to fall for it, over and over again.\\n\\nI would say... ask... beg... that you come to a new way of thinking: become a Moderate. Not just any moderate, become a hardcore moderate like me. Do you know what defines moderates? The idea that we can take in pieces of information in the media, view all sides and come to a conclusion without listening to the talking points of the left or right wing. Whenever I read a story about something happening, I immediately question it. I reference it, and I put it in context to what has happened previously in the history of our country. \\n\\nI can give you many examples of this, and luckily there are some Redditors who make it their mission to respond to alarmist headlines that appear in places like r/politics to point out where, factually, the alarmism is incorrect.']\n",

However, when I hear a college kid say he doesn't like where things are at, but doesn't want to get involved and instead just wants to quit and move away, it worries me. It speaks to what I hope is not a generational attitude of laziness. How will he deal with other problems that face him in life that seem \"too big\"? Lets be clear, we are all (not just the young generation) facing a tough job market. This job market looked this way in 2001 as well. It is not the first time, nor the last. And, as one astute redditor pointed out (I apologize for not having a link) the baby boom generation is leaving the workforce, which, over the course of the next decade will create a fantastic boom &amp; great job demand.\n",
