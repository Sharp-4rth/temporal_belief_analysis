That is nothing new. We need to start teaching youth to stop sensationalizing things and instead to analyze them and get involved. I fear that sites like reddit encourage a FOX News-like knee jerk reactive &amp; lazy liberal youth. \\n\\nAlso, you are talking about grassroots movements nationwide, I am talking about getting involved locally.

Positive lines have been crossed that were never crossed before.\\n\\nChanges in healthcare law, increasingly accepted gays in society, gay partnership and/or gay marriage, more readily available information about your government at your fingertips due to internet and government having to conform to making things available, and that is just to name a few.\\n\\nEconomically, in the past 25 years we have been up (Clinton) and down (now). No doubt there are shitty things happening with economic policy. But this will change.

It makes you feel like you were finally able to effect change over your predicament in a way that continuing to get abused never gives.

I'm not very young, I have a career and a family - I'm not some 20-something college student with a chip on my shoulder.

I feel that my vote and my voice are useless against the wall of power and money that had been erected by previous generations as well as a lot of greedy and ignorant peers.
