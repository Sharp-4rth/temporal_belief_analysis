I also think we should be trying to get off oil as soon as possible, we are FAR over due for that. Yet many conservatives label me as far left wing. I mean, ideally how great would it be for everyone to have electric cars, charged by solar panels on their own house?

How many bomb plots have they stopped? None? As soon as a terrorist puts a bomb up their ass, we\\'ll probably have anal probing at check in. I wish I was being sarcastic (I also never would have thought we would have full body scanners, but alas, the underwear bomber). The TSA is simply knee jerk reactionary to anything that happens. It\\'s useless. \\n\\nWe\\'re also detaining \"enemy combatants\" with no trial, indefinitely. That is literally about the most \"unamerican\" thing you could ever do. That\\'s exactly what the founding fathers wanted to protect against.

I feel like this country has become an Orwellian novel.\\n\\nYou do not feel that way because you consume, by and large, alarmist left wing media. There are people on the right who only consume alarmist right wing media and they are just as manipulated into believing false things about our country. This is what political factions want in this country. This is why they control our process, because people like you are willing to fall for it, over and over again.\\n\\nI would say... ask... beg... that you come to a new way of thinking: become a Moderate. Not just any moderate, become a hardcore moderate like me. Do you know what defines moderates? The idea that we can take in pieces of information in the media, view all sides and come to a conclusion without listening to the talking points of the left or right wing. Whenever I read a story about something happening, I immediately question it. I reference it, and I put it in context to what has happened previously in the history of our country. \\n\\nI can give you many examples of this, and luckily there are some Redditors who make it their mission to respond to alarmist headlines that appear in places like r/politics to point out where, factually, the alarmism is incorrect.']\n",
