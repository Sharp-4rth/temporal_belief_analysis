      "2025-06-28 12:11:05,916 - temporal_belief - INFO - 847246108:8 - Comment: One of the major arguments in favor of abortion is respect for the mother's bodily autonomy. There are many arguments against abortion, but this is the first one I've found that highlights how anti-feminist this rhetoric actually is because it seeks to identify the male as sexually normative. The excerpts below are only from one section and highlight only one line of thought from the paper; other thoughts are addressed throughout. What do you think of this argument?\n",
      "\n",
      "From [Embodied Equality: Debunking Equal Protection Arguments for Abortion Rights by Erika Bachiochi](http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1873485):\n",
      "\n",
      "&gt;*The equality argument from autonomy suggests that just as men can physiologically avoid the supremely consequential procreative potential of the sexual act, so too should women be enabled. That is, because the professional and personal lives of men need not be interrupted by an ill‐timed pregnancy, neither should the professional and personal lives of women. Scholars thus urge the Court to recognize that women who wish to have “non‐procreative sex” are as “entitled as men . . . to constitutional protection of their right to define their own destiny.” In other words, women are as entitled as men to remain detached from the potential consequences of sex—consequences that would impinge on their right to autonomously and uninterruptedly control and define the course of their lives. As Professor Laurence Tribe argues, “[w]hile men retain the right to sexual and reproductive autonomy, restrictions on abortion deny that autonomy to women.”*\n",
      "\n",
      "...\n",
      "\n",
      "&gt;*The law demands the full equality of the sexes. For the law to treat women and men equally, however, it must not ignore the biological reality that men and women’s bodies differ with regard to reproduction, a difference with varied and significant consequences. Men’s reproductive design makes them distant from the physical, emotional, and social complexity of pregnancy. It also enables them to shirk the responsibilities that come with siring offspring. Women are not so designed. The life‐giving consequences of the potentially procreative sexual act confront them with immediacy and gravity, a vulnerability that callous men have exploited throughout human history. The legal availability of abortion has worked to detach men further from the potentialities of female sexuality, offering them the illusion that sex can finally be completely consequence‐free. The trouble is that, for women, sex that results in pregnancy is fraught with consequence. Women must act affirmatively—and destructively—if they are to imitate male reproductive autonomy. Professor David Smolin captures starkly the cost to women of mimicking male autonomy: “[W]omen will always pay a higher price for their autonomy . . . . Only women have to experience the pain and physical intrusion of abortion to achieve autonomy.” And only women have to suffer the health consequences of their act, potentially impacting their future preg‐ nancies and future well‐being.*\n",
      "\n",
      "...\n",
      "\n",
      "&gt;*Seeking to imitate the autonomous, child‐abandoning male through abortion would seem rather con‐ trary to prowoman ideals, but Justice Ginsburg offers the pro‐ choice rationale: “[Women’s] ability to realize their full poten‐ tial...is intimately connected to ‘their ability to control their reproductive lives’” through abortion. Women can reach their full potential, Justice Ginsburg intimates, only by imitating men.*\n",
      "\n",
      "...\n",
      "\n",
      "&gt;*As the late Elizabeth Fox‐ Genovese, distinguished social historian and founder of the Emory University Women’s Studies Department, has stated, according to the prochoice feminist view:*\n",
      "\n",
      "&gt;&gt;*To enjoy full dignity and rights as an individual, a woman must resemble a man as closely as possible. It is difficult to imagine a more deadly assault upon a woman’s dignity as a woman. For this logic denies that a woman can be both a woman and a full individual.*\n",
      "\n",
      "&gt;To diminish women’s difference in this way and emblazon it in constitutional jurisprudence would further disempower an already marginalized group of women in American society. This group—mothers with dependent children—could not be more different from the standard‐bearing autonomous male. Once legal equality is conceived of in terms of male autonomy or detachment, the attachment and connectedness of a mother caring for her young children becomes a symbol of weakness and depravity rather than of care and sacrifice. Where auton‐ omy is exalted, vulnerability is pitied. And before long, the vulnerable are society’s pariah.\n",

Even without the Stumpster that is Trump hammering him early, it took him far too long to recover from his attacks. He runs the best funded republican campaign, yet can't even consistently stay in 5th place. I have trouble believing that a man who became the first two term republican in Florida history can be such a nightmare campaign wise. While I don't believe that he is being forced to run, I don't think he has any real passion for the presidency whatsoever.\n",
